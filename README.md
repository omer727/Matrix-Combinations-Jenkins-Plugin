The plugin is inspired from the Matrix Reloaded Plugin and allows the user to choose which matrix combinations he
wants to run.

This plugin add a new type of parameter.
When the user build a matrix project with this parameter type he gets a html table with checkbox for each combination.
It gets from the user which combinations he wants to run, and translate it into a groovy condition such as:

axis1=="axis1value1" && axis2=="axis2value1" || axis1=="axis1value2" && axis2=="axis2value2" || ...
